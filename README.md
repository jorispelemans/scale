# SCALE -- A Scalable Language Engineering Toolkit

SCALE is a Python toolkit that contains two extensions to n-gram Language Models: Semantic Head Mapping (SHM) and Bag-of-Words Language Modeling (BagLM). Both of them scale to large data and allow the integration into first-pass ASR decoding. The toolkit is open source, includes working examples and can be found on http://github.com/jorispelemans/scale.
